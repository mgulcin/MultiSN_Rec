# Making recommendations by integrating information from multiple social networks

People generally use different web-based platforms for different purposes. Integrating data from multiple platforms may widen the perspective of the analysis and may help in modeling users more effectively. Motivated by this, we developed a recommendation framework which integrates data collected from multiple platforms. We collected and anonymized datasets which contain information from several social networking and social media platforms, namely BlogCatalog, Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, YouTube and LastFm. We implemented a number of recommendation methodologies to observe their performance for various cases which involve using single versus multiple features from a single source versus multiple sources.
